    About Me    
    </h2>

    <p>Before joining my current program, I had the privilege of refining my skills as a 3D Designer in Hong Kong, where I worked on a variety of projects, ranging from medical animation to product design. My experience has taught me that the field of design is constantly evolving, and to stay ahead of the curve, one must be willing to <em>learn and grow</em> continuously. That's why I'm confident that the knowledge and skills I'm acquiring in my current program will enable me to become an accomplished multimedia designer with a diverse portfolio of projects. With my passion, creativity, and commitment, I'm excited to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the industry.</p>

	<p>Whenever I'm feeling unmotivated and lacking energy to work hard or contemplating taking a day off, this quote immediately comes to mind. It tells us to work hard not just when we want to, but all thetime. It's about setting <em>high standards</em> and then working to both <em>achieve</em> and <em>maintain</em> them. I understand that time is a precious commodity and that investing it wisely is essential for success. Through <em>hard work</em>, <em>dedication</em>, and a willingness to <em>learn and grow</em>, it's motivating me to work hard and become who I want to be in the future.</p>

    <h3>1. Illustration</h3>

    <p>I love create illustration that tells a story, conveys an emotion, or simply captures the beauty of the world around us. Illustration can be done using variety od mediums, from tradition pen and paper to digital tablets and software. each medium has its own unique benefits and challenges, allowing me to experiment and explore my creativity in different ways. One of the joys of illustration is the ability to share my art with others. I can display my work online, ingalleries, or even on everyday items such as t-shirt and mugs.

    <h3>2. Hiking</h3>

    <p>Hiking is a hobby that allow me to explore the beauty and diversity of the natural world. Whenever you're trekking throught forests, climbing mountains, or wandering along coastlines, hiking provides a physical and mental challenge that can be exhilarating and relaxing. Hiking is not only a great way to stay active and healthy, but it also provides an opportunity to disconnect from the digital world and connect with nature. The peace and quiet of the outdoors can be increadiby therapeutic, helping to reduce stress and improve mental clarity.</p>
