    About Me    
    </h2>


    <p> Before joining my current program, I had the privilege of refining my skills as a 3D Designer in Hong Kong, where I worked on a variety of projects, ranging from medical animation to product design. My experience has taught me that the field of design is constantly evolving, and to stay ahead of the curve, one must be willing to <em>learn and grow</em> continuously. That's why I'm confident that the knowledge and skills I'm acquiring in my current program will enable me to become an accomplished multimedia designer with a diverse portfolio of projects. With my passion, creativity, and commitment, I'm excited to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the industry. </p>

	<p>Whenever I'm feeling unmotivated and lacking energy to work hard or contemplating taking a day off, this quote immediately comes to mind. It tells us to work hard not just when we want to, but all thetime. It's about setting <em>high standards</em> and then working to both <em>achieve</em> and <em>maintain</em> them. I understand that time is a precious commodity and that investing it wisely is essential for success. Through <em>hard work</em>, <em>dedication</em>, and a willingness to <em>learn and grow</em>, it's motivating me to work hard and become who I want to be in the future.</p>
